# 🌐 Welcome to the My First Bitcoin Translation Repository

This is where **language meets impact**.  

Here, we’re breaking down barriers by making Bitcoin education accessible to everyone, everywhere – no matter what language they speak.

📖 To expand our reach and increase communication, we've also launched a [Translation Wiki](https://network.myfirstbitcoin.io/c/translation/16) on our [Community Hub](https://network.myfirstbitcoin.io), where you'll find step-by-step guides to help you get started with contributing.

💡 *Because open knowledge changes lives, and translations make it global.*
